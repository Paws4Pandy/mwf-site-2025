Unlike the major Canadian banks, we approve on equity, not credit.\n\nA power of sale is a commonly used legal process in Ontario, which allows the mortgage lender to sell your property and recover their money. We stop this process and keep you at home.\n\nWe have a network of Ontario private mortgage lenders who lend on properties across Ontario. We get quotes from multiple lenders to ensure that you get the best deal.\n\nA “Cash House Buyer” is an individual or corporation with the cash on hand to purchase real estate outright. Their goal typically is to rent or resell the property for a profit.\n\nAt Mortgage Broker Store, we are both a mortgage brokerage and a direct private lender.\n\nIn some cases, we act as a middleman between borrowers and lenders, and in other cases, we personally lend on mortgages.\n\nFor more information, visit our [About Us](https://mortgagebrokerstore.com/about) and Author Bio Pages Below:\n\n[Jonathan Alphonso](https://mortgagebrokerstore.com/about/jonathan-alphonso)\n\nAs mortgage brokers, we can help you get the mortgage or loan that you need.

A property can have many mortgages, and they are numbered in the order in which they are placed on the property. A mortgage that is placed after a first mortgage and before a third mortgage (if applicable) is a **Second Mortgage**.\n\nSecond mortgages in Ontario are popular offerings from private and alternative lenders as many banks consider this type of investment to be too risky. Our mortgage advisors can help you determine what type of mortgage you require.\n\n[Visit our FAQ Post for more info on “What is a Second Mortgage?”](https://mortgagebrokerstore.com/faq/what-is-a-second-mortgage)\n\nAny non-bank mortgage lender can either be refereed to as a **Private Mortgage Lender** or an **Alternative Mortgage Lender**. Private lenders are typically individuals while alternative lenders are organizations such as trust companies, mortgage syndicates, and mortgage investment corps (MICs). These lenders primarily service people who cannot qualify for bank mortgages. These lenders have a high tolerance for risk, but charge setup fees and higher interest rates than banks do. We have many Toronto private lenders and private lenders across Ontario to fund your mortgage.\n\n[Visit our FAQ Post for more info on “What are Private Lenders?”](https://mortgagebrokerstore.com/faq/what-is-private-lending)\n\nWhen mortgage payments are not made, or other terms of the mortgage agreement are not met, the lender has the right to recover their investment via the **Power of Sale** or **Foreclosure** process. In Ontario the vast majority of mortgage lenders opt to use the power of sale process since it is faster and less costly. The key differences is that power of sale is a faster, cheaper process that allows the lender to [sell the property](https://mortgagebrokerstore.com/sell-my-house-fast-ontario) to recover their money while foreclosure grants the lender ownership of the property. Any excess profits from the property’s sale must go to the former homeowner, however this typically isn’t much. Any fees incurred by the lender to process the power of sale or foreclosure are charged back to the mortgage. The final fee at the end of the process can be upwards of $30,000 which typically results in the former homeowner receiving nothing. If you are a homeowner under power of sale or foreclosure, it is strongly recommended to deal with the situation before the lender takes control of the property.\n\n[Visit Our FAQ Post for more info on “What is Power of Sale?”](https://mortgagebrokerstore.com/faq/can-i-stop-a-foreclosure)\n\nA **Home Equity Loan** is any type of loan where a person’s house is used as collateral. In order to get approved for this kind of loan, the homeowner must have a sizable amount of home equity. Home equity is the difference between the value of the property and the value of the existing debts on the property. Home equity loans can take several forms including first mortgages, second mortgages, and personal loans (which may be registered as either a lien or mortgage). Home equity loans are different from Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC) which are revolving lines of credit and can be used similar to a credit card. Private and alternative lenders are the most common sources of high risk home equity loans.\n\n[Visit Our FAQ Post for more info on “What is a Home Equity Loan?”](https://mortgagebrokerstore.com/faq/what-is-a-home-equity-loan)\n\nScarborough, East York, North York, Etobicoke and the former City of Toronto were amalgamated to form the present City of Toronto.\n\nScarborough is on the eastern side of Toronto, it was made up of smaller towns which include Agincourt, Guildwood, West Hill, The Bluffs , Wexford and Woburn.
